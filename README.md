# Evaluate News Articles with Natural Language Processing

## About

The goal of this project is to learn:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external URLs

NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning to create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> Process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a master's degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public-facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting started

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:

- `npm install`

## Setting up the API

Meaning Cloud API is used in the project for Sentiment Analysis.

## Results
